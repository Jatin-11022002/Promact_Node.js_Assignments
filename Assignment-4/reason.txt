The choice between EJS, Pug (formerly Jade), and Handlebars depends on various factors, including personal preference, project requirements, and familiarity with the syntax. Here are some reasons why you might choose EJS over Pug or Handlebars:

Familiarity with JavaScript syntax: If you are already familiar with JavaScript, EJS might feel more comfortable because it allows you to embed JavaScript directly within your HTML templates. This can make it easier to work with if you're primarily a JavaScript developer.

Compatibility with existing HTML files: EJS templates closely resemble traditional HTML files, with JavaScript code embedded using <% %> tags. If you have existing HTML files that you want to convert into dynamic templates, EJS may require fewer changes to your existing codebase compared to Pug, which has a whitespace-sensitive syntax, or Handlebars, which uses its own syntax for embedding logic.

Flexibility and simplicity: EJS is a simple and straightforward templating engine that doesn't impose many restrictions on how you structure your templates. It's easy to learn and understand, making it a good choice for projects where simplicity and flexibility are important.

Tight integration with Express.js: EJS is often recommended for use with Express.js because it's supported out of the box and integrates seamlessly with the framework. It's easy to set up and configure EJS templates in an Express.js application, making it a popular choice among Express developers.

That said, each templating engine has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the "best" choice depends on your specific project requirements and preferences. Pug offers a more concise and expressive syntax, which can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code in some cases. Handlebars provides a logic-less syntax that makes it easy to write and read templates, with support for partials, helpers, and data binding. Ultimately, you should evaluate the features and syntax of each templating engine to determine which one best fits your needs.
